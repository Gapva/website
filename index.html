        <h3>What is Coop <span class="dx">Deluxe</span>?</h3>
        <p>We are a team of people who came together after sm64ex-coop and its development environment became too toxic and filled with drama, led by someone who thinks avoiding drama is the best route to solving it. Our goal with this project is to provide a better community and a better maintained and customizable game.</p>
        <p><strong>sm64coop<span class="dx">dx</span></strong> is an actively maintained fork of sm64ex-coop with more features, customizability and power to the Lua API. A lot of additions have been made to the Lua API to increase its power and functionality such as brand new hooks, structs, systems, functions, better documentation and more. Now with it being unchained from the sm64ex-coop developers, bigger and crazier mods can be made.</p>

        <h3>What makes this different from sm64ex-coop?</h3>
        <p>This project has a massively improved ROM to executable patcher which takes <strong>seconds</strong> to output an executable instead of anywhere from 10 minutes to 10 hours. It also has additional multiplayer features, customization options galore, new built-in mods, tons of new Lua functionality and more!</p>
        <br>
        <h3>Coop <span class="dx">Deluxe</span> Exclusive Built-in Mods!</h3>
        <div class="container text-center my-4">
            <div class="row g-4">
                <h4>Gun Mod <span class="dx">DX</span></h4>
                <div class="col-md-6">
                    <img src="gun1.png" alt="Gun Mod screenshot" width="100%">
                </div>
                <div class="col-md-6">
                    <img src="gun2.png" alt="Gun Mod screenshot" width="100%">
                </div>
                <p>This is a complete rewrite of Agent X's first mod, Gun Mod. Originally made for sm64ex-coop and not made out to what it could be due to a lack of experience, the old Gun Mod was not the greatest and had much room for improvement. Taking the opportunity, Agent X decided this would be one of the two mods he was going to overhaul to be bundled in with <strong>sm64coop<span class="dx">dx</span></strong>.</p>
                <h4>Day Night Cycle <span class="dx">DX</span></h4>
                <div class="col-md-6">
                    <img src="daynight1.png" alt="Day-Night Cycle screenshot" width="100%">
                </div>
                <div class="col-md-6">
                    <img src="daynight2.png" alt="Day-Night Cycle screenshot" width="100%">
                </div>
                <p>This is a graphically overhauled and functionally improved version of Agent X's technically impressive Day Night Cycle. Originally limited by the lack of graphical altering functionality in Lua and knowing trying to implement it would likely get turned down by the developers, Agent X decided to only change the lighting direction and render a rectangle on the HUD to give the illusion of it being darker. This of course, didn't look very good, and now with the ability to change vertex color, light color, fog color, fog intensity the graphics of this mod have been majorly improved.</p>

        <h3>How do I play sm64coop<span class="dx">dx</span>?</h3>
        <p>On December 18th, 2023 at 5:00 PM EST, all Coop <span class="dx">Deluxe</span> repos will be unprivated and the download link to the patcher as well as the repo will be available on this website.</p>
        <!--p>Download coopdx-patcher <a href="funny.png">here</a> and drag a <code>.z64</code> ROM of SM64 to get started!</p></p-->
        <h3>FAQs with Agent X</h3>
        <p>Q: Is this project to spite djoslin0?</p>
        <p>A: That would be petty. I am working on this project out of my continued passion for SM64 multiplayer projects, and while the others all got toxic, I won't let that happen to this one. We are also trying to peacefully co-exist with sm64ex-coop, <strong>we do not intend on waging crazy internet war over Super Mario 64.</strong></p>
        <br>
        <p>Q: How do I join the Discord server?</p>
        <p>A: The Discord server is a closed server that gains new people by friend to friend inviting. We have it this way for two reasons. One, large public community servers <strong>fester toxicity</strong> quickly and are harder to moderate. Two, we want this server to be <strong>a chill place where people can talk and show off things,</strong> not a McDonalds playplace or a daycare center.</p>
        <br>
        <p>Q: Do I need sm64ex-coop for this?</p>
        <p>A: No, with the patcher all you need to do is drag a ROM onto it and it will automatically output an executable, no need for any involvement with sm64ex-coop.</p>
        <br>
        <p>Q: Is the patcher cross-platform?</p>
        <p>A: It is Windows only, at least for now. I made it using .NET Framework 4.7 so older computers can run it without any compatibility issues.</p>
        <br>
        <p>Q: Where can I suggest things or report bugs if I'm not in the Discord?</p>
        <p>A: You can suggest things or report bugs on the GitHub repository.</p>
        <br>
        <p>Q: Will there be more than 16 player support, or can we tilt the torso anytime, or have custom mtx transforms, or Lua based GEO_ASMs?</p>
        <p>A: More than 16 player support will come in the future, but besides that yes to all of those, except for the last one. This is a question I saw someone ask.</p>
